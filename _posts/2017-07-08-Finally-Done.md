<h2>WELL... IT FEELS GOOD</h2>
<p>So, I'm finally finished - after hours upon hours attempting different methods and startegies in both my html layout and css, I have finally made my images cropped. I didn't use the most elegant of solutions, but it works, and I think that's all that matters. Having managed to do this, I can now move on to developing other areas of my website and adding other features. If you have any ideas, go ahead and click the mail icon below to send me an email.</p>
