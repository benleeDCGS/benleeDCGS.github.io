<h2>THE BEGINNING</h2>
This lesson we were asked to delete everything. Everything. At first I was upset and disappointed that all the time and effort I had put into my website previously had been wasted and that I had to start a fresh. Then I saw the bright side of it, the opportunity to restart and to try again to make a nice style that looks good. I needed to do some research.
  After hours of research and a LOT of procrastination, I decided on a style. I had chosen everything; colours, yes, colo<strong>u</strong>rs <strong>not</strong> colors, fonts, designs. Now, it was onto the real work, the coding.
  
<h2>THE STRUGGLE ENSUES</h2>
Hours passed, yet very little progress was made, I developed a header that looked decent enough, although I was later going to hav to fight with the vertical alignment of the nav bar on different screen sizes. I had sorted out my fonts, container and everything else necessary including the design of the post that you're reading this from now. Then, it was on tio the home page which, by now, had completely disappeared. It was time to go into the layouts.
  I needed to make the css rules seperate for each seperate page. I.e. post layouts and the home layout used completely different css rules so that they didn't conflict one another. This was a long, and rather dull, process, taking me many hours, especially making it so that each page then worked.
