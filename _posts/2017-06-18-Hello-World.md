<h2>THE BEGINNING</h2>
This lesson we were asked to delete everything. Everything. At first I was upset and disappointed that all the time and effort I had put into my website previously had been wasted and that I had to start a fresh. Then I saw the bright side of it, the opportunity to restart and to try again to make a nice style that looks good. I needed to do some research.
  After hours of research and a LOT of procrastination, I decided on a style. I had chosen everything; colours, yes, colo<strong>u</strong>rs <strong>not</strong> colors, fonts, designs. Now, it was onto the real work, the coding.
  
<h2>THE STRUGGLE ENSUES</h2>
Hours passed, yet very little progress was made, I developed a header that looked decent enough, although I was later going to hav to fight with the vertical alignment of the nav bar on different screen sizes. I had sorted out my fonts, container and everything else necessary including the design of the post that you're reading this from now. Then, it was on to the home page which, by now, had completely disappeared. It was time to go into the layouts.
  I needed to make the css rules seperate for each seperate page. I.e. post layouts and the home layout used completely different css rules so that they didn't conflict one another. This was a long, and rather dull, process, taking me many hours, especially making it so that each page then worked.
  Having spent many hours typing and retyping css rules and html layouts, I finally had something that was vaguely like what I had imagined. I had text on top of an image, in the center. Now onto the easy thing - adding an animation for the text and image, so that the text changes color on hover an the image comes from being 'invisible' to being 'visible'. This didn't take too long, however, I had to think for a while about how to get the hover to cover the entire area, and not just either the text area or the image area. 
  
<h2>THE PROGRESS SO FAR...</h2>
So, I have a working post layout. I have a hme page layout that I am happy with, however, there is still a long struggle ahead in order to fix the issues with cropping the images - if you have any suggestions, please don't hesitate to click the mail icon at the bottom of the page to email me.
  This post has covered my work for the past couple of weeks, after restarting my blog project. Again, if you have any suggestions about my design, layout, or even just saying what you like about my current blog, please do click the mail icon at the bottom of the page and I will consider your suggestion and change my site accordingly, if it's not too difficult!
